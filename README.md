An application that guides users through the checkout process, collects data, and displays queried GitHub account information.

The code was prettified by VSCode's extension 'Prettier'.

## How to run the project

You need to have npm or yarn installed globally, then run in the project root
`npm install` or `yarn`
to have the build dependencies installed.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
